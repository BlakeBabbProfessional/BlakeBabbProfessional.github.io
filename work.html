            <p>
                I am currently looking for a full-time job in software development.
                I am based in Bend, Oregon but I am open to positions all over
                the West Coast. My skills and interests lie in embedded systems, system
                administration, simulation, and game development.
                <br><br>
                I am also interested in interning at game development studios to
                get a more intimate understanding of the game development industry
                and to see how professional studios operate.

            <p>
                In the summer of 2022 I worked as an electrical engineering
                intern at AcraDyne, the engineering division of the Portland-based
                company AIMCO. Initially my focus was on sitting in on Agile engineering
                meetings, shadowing junior and senior engineers, and fixing minor
                bugs. But as I got more experienced I was tasked with fixing more
                complicated bugs and even creating new features, becoming an active
                member of the team and participating more in meetings.
                <br><br>
                My largest project was
                to add a new feature for AcraDyne's precision fastening system:
                a toggleable option to automatically turn tool indicator lights
                off after a configurable period of time. I developed the feature
                from start to completion; incuding implementing the mechanics of
                the feature in the tool's C++ firmware codebase using timers and
                threading, implementing storage of the configuration in a SQLite
                database, creating additions to the Qt user interface, and documenting
                the feature in both internal and external documentation.
                <br><br>
                I am very proud of the time I spent at AcraDyne, I worked closely
                with several more experienced engineers, I learned a lot about
                development processes, I didn't break anything, and
                I made real contributions to production code on tools used by
                customers.
