            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am very outdoorsy; I love skiing, hiking, camping, paddleboarding,
                and taking long drives through the forest. I also like seeing live
                music and taking rambling walks through cities.
                <br><br>
                I am a big gamer, my favorites include Minecraft, Terraria, Rain World
                and Celeste. My love of video games spills over into my creative
                hobbies; I love making games just as much as playing them! I've made
                around a dozen little games on my own and with my friends.
