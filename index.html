        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            I am Blake Babb, and I am currently looking for a job as a
            Software Developer. I have a BS in Computer Science from
            Oregon State University completed in 2024. I have experience
            interning at the engineering division of the Portland-based tech
            company AIMCO. I also have extensive experience as a hobbyist
            game developer.
            <br><br>
            I am currently based in Bend, Oregon but I am open to positions all
            over the west coast. I'd love to explore more of whats out there!

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am very outdoorsy; I love skiing, hiking, camping, paddleboarding,
            and taking long drives through the forest. I also like seeing live
            music and taking rambling walks through the forest.
            <br><br>
            I am a big gamer, my favorites include Minecraft, Terraria, Rain World
            and Celeste. My love of video games spills over into my creative
            hobbies; I love making games just as much as playing them! I've made
            some dozen odd little games on my own and with my friends.
