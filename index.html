                I graduated from Oregon State University in June of 2024 with a

                operating systems, computer networking & security,

                For my 2024 senior capstone project I worked as part of a team
                on a project we called the Personal Data Acquisition Prototype,
                or P-DAQ. The team consisted of myself, my classmates Aidan Agee,
                Jake Goodwin, and Patrick Iacob, along with industry professional
                Chris Patton, former SpaceX engineer.
                Our project was a prototype data logger of the likes found in
                the aerospace and automotive industries, but designed for the
                budget and use cases of amatuer hobbyists.
                <br><br>
                The project was developed from start to finished in Rust over nine
                months with the direction of our project partner Chris Patton and
                the oversight of a teacher's assistant. After completion, me and my
                teammates presented our project at a public expo for College of
                Engineering capstone projects.

            <h2>My Role</h2>
            <p>
                I was part of the UI development subteam, and my focus was on
                data processing and display. I created data structures and
                functions to automatically refresh and
                asynchronously recieve read data from a SQLite database to be
                displayed in graphs and tables using the Rust eGui framework.
                I took great effort to ensure null safety and modularity, to
                reduce unexpected behavior and allow for extensability if sensors
                are added and removed.

                The user interface was designed by myself and my teammate Aidan
                Agee using the eGui Rust framework. It is
                hosted as a Rust Rocket webserver from the Raspberry PI, which could
                then be connected to over WiFi by a user's personal device.
                The map, graphs, and tables in the UI all use asynchronous
                functions to live-update based on data from the device's
                sensors stored in a SQLite database.

            <h2>Development Process</h2>
            <p>
                For this project we learned the practicalities of version
                control and project & team organization. We had weekly meetings
                both with our project TA to help keep us on track, and with our
                project partner to discuss issues and requirements.
                Along the way we learned the importance of establishing appropriate deadlines
                regularly reporting our progress, and by the end
                of the project we were working very well together and I am proud
                of what we created.
                <br><br>
                The course taught us how to explicitely define requirements,
                architecture, and our development process in documents and how
                to write up weekly reports. This was unfamiliar to us at first
                because we had never needed to explicitly define these things
                as we had never worked on a project of this scale or duration
                before, but it ended up being useful to clearly define our plans
                and expectations beforehand.

                Active queue management (AQM) is a general approach for managing

                for my Computer Networking class
                myself and two classmates researched, implemented, and tested
                several different AQM techniques. We read a series of IEEE papers
                where each technique was first introduced, then based on what
                we read we implemented the techniques in the NS3 C++ network
                simulator, ran experiments with them, and finally reported our

            <p>
                In the summer of 2022 I worked as an electrical engineering
                intern at AcraDyne, the engineering division of the Portland-based
                company AIMCO. Initially my focus was on sitting in on engineering
                meetings, shadowing junior and senior engineers, and fixing minor
                bugs. But as I got more experienced I was tasked with fixing more
                complicated bugs and even creating new features.
                <br><br>
                <!--One of my projects was to update an old Python-based database
                explorer tool to be up-to-date with newer versions of the database
                and to be more resiliant and user-friendly.-->
                My largest project was
                to add a new feature for AcraDyne's precision fastening system:
                a toggleable option to automatically turn tool indicator lights
                off after a configurable period of time. I developed the feature
                from start to completion; incuding implementing the mechanics of
                the feature in the tool's C++ firmware codebase using timers and
                threading, implementing storage of the configuration in a SQLite
                database, creating additions to the Qt user interface, and documenting
                the feature in both internal and external documentation.
                <br><br>
                I am very proud of the time I spent at AcraDyne, I worked closely
                with several more experienced engineers, I learned a lot about
                development processes, I didn't (permanantly) break anything, and
                I made real contributions to production code on tools used by
                customers.

                finish in a set period of time. They are usually community judged
                and ranked on creativity, aestetics, and gameplay. I have
                participated in numerous Game Jams solo and as part of a team.
                Below is a selection of my favorite submissions.

                Developed in GameMaker over two weeks by me and my sibling Meta
                for the Mech Jam V.
                Play as the operator of a mech repair facility fixing up mechs
                damaged in combat. Experimental gameplay inspired by claw machines
                and industrial manufacturing facilities.
                <br><br>
                Meta drew the mechs and the background and did most of the sound
                design while I programmed it and drew the control panel.
                Still a work in progress, as playtesting revealed flaws in the
                tutorial, which is being reworked with playtester feedback.

                Developed in GameMaker over 72 hours for the Winter Melon Jam 2023
                as part of a team of four.
                Play as the owner of a sinister beauty parlor and try to convince
                monsters to accept your "treatments".
                <br><br>
                This was the first complete game I made in GameMaker, which we
                chose because of its ease of use and ability to export to HTML5,
                which is much more accessible and convenient for players. This
                was also my first game I worked on as part of such a large team,
                which went very well.

                Developed in Java 8 over 72 hours for Mini Jam 87 as part of a team of
                three. Play as a little creature lost and injured in a dark forest,
                who must scavenge new body parts to make their way back to their
                family.
                <br><br>
                Was an unexpected hit on Itch.io, organically drawing several
                thousand views and over one thousand downloads.
                <br><br>
                I am particularly proud of this one because of its strong atmosphere,
                brought to life by my sibling Meta's incredible creature and background
                design, my friend Raine's expressive creature AI, and my sound and
                level design.

                Developed in Java 8 over 72 hours for Mini Jam 84 by me and my
                sibling Meta. A silly little arcade game about trying to protect
                pufferfish from becoming dinner in a seafood restaraunt by
                flinging them into things.
                <br><br>
                The first game I worked on as part of a collaboration; my sibling
                Meta did all the art and sound design, and I did all the
                programming. Placed first in the Game Jam out of 154 entries as rated
                by fellow participants.
                <br><br>
                I'm very proud of this one, it feels very
                simple yet high-quality. I keep telling myself I'll try something
                less ambitious like this, but I find myself drawn to heady concepts
                and unique challenges.

                Developed in Java 8 over 72 hours for Mini Jam 83, solo.
                Play as an explorer spelunking in dark dangerous caves, that must
                roll magic dice to create a light source.
                <br><br>
                This was
                my second ever Game Jam, and I did it completely solo; doing all the
                programming, art, sound design, and level design.
                Placed ninth for the concept out of 115 entries as rated by fellow
                participants.

                A mod I made for the 2019 game <em>Outer Wilds</em> that adds a
                speculative depiction of the real-life TRAPPIST-1 exoplanet system
                based on real scientific research. Intended as a way to teach about
                the TRAPPIST-1 system and exoplanet research in general.
