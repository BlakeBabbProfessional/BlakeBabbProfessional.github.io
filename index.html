        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            I am Blake Babb, and I am currently looking for a job as a
            Software Developer. I have a BS in Computer Science from
            Oregon State University completed in 2024. I have experience
            interning at the engineering division of the Portland-based tech
            company AIMCO. I also have extensive experience as a hobbyist
            game developer.
            <br><br>
            I am currently based in Bend, Oregon but I am open to positions all
            over the west coast. I'd love to explore more of whats out there!

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am very outdoorsy; I love skiing, hiking, camping, paddleboarding,
            and taking long drives through the forest. I also like seeing live
            music and taking rambling walks through the forest.
            <br><br>
            I am a big gamer, my favorites include Minecraft, Terraria, Rain World
            and Celeste. My love of video games spills over into my creative
            hobbies; I love making games just as much as playing them! I've made
            some dozen odd little games on my own and with my friends.

        <p>
            For my 2024 senior capstone project I worked as part of a team
            on a project we called the "personal data acquisition prototype",
            or "P-DAQ". The team consisted of myself, my classmates Aidan Agee,
            Jake Goodwin, and Patrick Iacob, along with an industry professional
            project partner Chris Patton.
            Our project was a prototype data logger of the likes found in
            the aerospace and automotive industries, but designed for the
            budget and use cases of amatuer hobbyists.
            <br><br>
            The project was developed from start to finished in Rust over nine
            months with the direction of our project partner Chris Patton and
            the oversight of a teacher's assistant. After completion, me and my
            teammates presented our project at a public expo for college of
            engineering captone projects.

            We split our team into two subteams based on expertise to focus on
            different aspects of the project: a hardware and firmware subteam,
            and a software subteam. Myself and Aidan Agee were on the software
            subteam, and we focused on the user interface and data storage.
            <br><br>
            The user interface was designed with the eGui Rust framework, and
            hosted as a Rust Rocket webserver from the Raspberry PI, which could
            then be connected to over WiFi by a user's personal device.

            A Game Jam is a competition to develop and publish
            a small game from start to
            finish in a set period of time. They are usually community judged
            and ranked on creativity, aestetics, and gameplay. I have
            participated in numerous Game Jams solo and as part of a team.
            Below is a selection of my favorite submissions.

            Developed in GameMaker over two weeks by me and my sibling Meta
            for the Mech Jam V.
            Play as the operator of a mech repair facility fixing up mechs
            damaged in combat. Experimental gameplay inspired by claw machines
            and industrial manufacturing facilities.
            <br><br>
            Meta drew the mechs and the background and did most of the sound
            design while I programmed it and drew the control panel.
            Still a work in progress, as playtesting revealed flaws in the
            tutorial, which is being reworked with playtester feedback.

            Developed in GameMaker over 72 hours for the Winter Melon Jam 2023
            as part of a team of four.
            Play as the owner of a sinister beauty parlor and try to convince
            monsters to accept your "treatments".
            <br><br>
            This was the first complete game I made in GameMaker, which we
            chose because of its ease of use and ability to export to HTML5,
            which is much more accessible and convenient for players. This
            was also my first game I worked on as part of such a large team,
            which went unexpectedly well; we worked very well together.
            <br><br>
            Monster Parlor was an unexpected hit on YouTube, with a lets play
            by YouTuber ManlyBadassHero accumulating over one hundred thousand
            views, inspiring several theory and analysis videos. This was
            quite unexpected as we had done no marketing besides submitting
            to the Winter Melon Jam and publishing on Itch.io, it is thanks
            to ManlyBadassHero that our game was found.

            Developed in Java 8 over 72 hours for Mini Jam 87 as part of a team of
            three. Play as a little creature lost an injured in a dark forest,
            who must scavenge new body parts to make their way back to their
            family.
            <br><br>
            Was an unexpected hit on Itch.io, organically drawing several
            thousand views and over one thousand downloads.
            <br><br>
            I am particularly proud of this one because of its strong atmosphere,
            brought to life by my sibling Meta's incredible creature and background
            design, my friend Raine's expressive creature AI, and my sound and
            level design.

            Developed in Java 8 over 72 hours for Mini Jam 84 by me and my
            sibling Meta. A silly little arcade game about trying to protect
            pufferfish from being caught and cooked in a seafood restaraunt by
            flinging them into things.
            <br><br>
            The first game I worked on as part of a collaboration, with my sibling
            Meta doing all the art and sound design, and myself doing all the
            programming. Placed first in the Game Jam out of 154 entries as rated
            by fellow participants.
            <br><br>
            I'm very proud of this one, it feels very
            simple yet high-quality. I keep telling myself I'll try something
            less ambitious like this, but I find myself drawn to heady concepts
            and unique challenges.

            <br><br>
            This was
            my second ever Game Jam, and I did it completely solo; doing all the
            programming, art, sound design, and level design.
            Placed ninth for the concept out of 115 entries as rated by fellow
            participants.
