            For my 2024 senior capstone project I worked as part of a team
            on a project we called the "personal data acquisition prototype",
            or "P-DAQ". The team consisted of myself, my classmates Aidan Agee,
            Jake Goodwin, and Patrick Iacob, along with an industry professional
            project partner Chris Patton.
            Our project was a prototype data logger of the likes found in
            the aerospace and automotive industries, but designed for the
            budget and use cases of amatuer hobbyists.
            <br><br>
            The project was developed from start to finished in Rust over nine
            months with the direction of our project partner Chris Patton and
            the oversight of a teacher's assistant. After completion, me and my
            teammates presented our project at a public expo for college of
            engineering captone projects.

            We split our team into two subteams based on expertise to focus on
            different aspects of the project: a hardware and firmware subteam,
            and a software subteam. Myself and Aidan Agee were on the software
            subteam, and we focused on the user interface and data storage.
            <br><br>
            The user interface was designed with the eGui Rust framework, and
            hosted as a Rust Rocket webserver from the Raspberry PI, which could
            then be connected to over WiFi by a user's personal device.
