            <h2>Bachelor of Science - Computer Science Major<br>
                <em>Oregon State University</em></h2>
            <p>
                I graduated from Oregon State University in June of 2024 with a
                BS in Computer Science. My focus was computer systems, which involved
                operating systems, computer networking & security,
                compilers, and embedded systems.
                <br><br>
                During my time at OSU I learned many practical skills on a range
                of topics; I learned how to work on a large project as
                part of a team, organizational and time management skills,
                and various development processess and structures.

            <p>
                For my 2024 senior capstone project I worked as part of a team
                on a project we called the Personal Data Acquisition Prototype,
                or P-DAQ. The team consisted of myself, my classmates Aidan Agee,
                Jake Goodwin, and Patrick Iacob, along with industry professional
                Chris Patton, former SpaceX engineer.
                Our project was a prototype data logger of the likes found in
                the aerospace and automotive industries, but designed for the
                budget and use cases of amatuer hobbyists.
                <br><br>
                The project was developed from start to finished in Rust over nine
                months with the direction of our project partner Chris Patton and
                the oversight of a teacher's assistant. After completion, me and my
                teammates presented our project at a public expo for College of
                Engineering capstone projects.

            <h2>My Role</h2>
            <p>
                I was part of the UI development subteam, and my focus was on
                data processing and display. I created data structures and
                functions to automatically refresh and
                asynchronously recieve read data from a SQLite database to be
                displayed in graphs and tables using the Rust eGui framework.
                I took great effort to ensure null safety and modularity, to
                reduce unexpected behavior and allow for extensability if sensors
                are added and removed.

            <p>
                The user interface was designed by myself and my teammate Aidan
                Agee using the eGui Rust framework. It is
                hosted as a Rust Rocket webserver from the Raspberry PI, which could
                then be connected to over WiFi by a user's personal device.
                The map, graphs, and tables in the UI all use asynchronous
                functions to live-update based on data from the device's
                sensors stored in a SQLite database.

            <h2>Development Process</h2>
            <p>
                For this project we learned the practicalities of version
                control and project & team organization. We had weekly meetings
                both with our project TA to help keep us on track, and with our
                project partner to discuss issues and requirements.
                Along the way we learned the importance of establishing appropriate deadlines
                regularly reporting our progress, and by the end
                of the project we were working very well together and I am proud
                of what we created.
                <br><br>
                The course taught us how to explicitely define requirements,
                architecture, and our development process in documents and how
                to write up weekly reports. This was unfamiliar to us at first
                because we had never needed to explicitly define these things
                as we had never worked on a project of this scale or duration
                before, but it ended up being useful to clearly define our plans
                and expectations beforehand.

                For my Data Visualization class I was tasked with creating several
                data visualizations for any subject I found interesting. I chose
                to study exoplanet research to answer several questions I had
                about the field. Included are my favorite visualizations, made in
                Kotlin.

            <h2>Active Queue Management Technique Experiments</h2>
            <p>
                Active queue management (AQM) is a general approach for managing
                congestion in computer networks. As part of a group project
                for my Computer Networking class
                myself and two classmates researched, implemented, and tested
                several different AQM techniques. We read a series of IEEE papers
                where each technique was first introduced, then based on what
                we read we implemented the techniques in the NS3 C++ network
                simulator, ran experiments with them, and finally reported our
                results.
