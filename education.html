            <h2>Bachelor of Science - Computer Science Major<br>
                <em>Oregon State University</em></h2>
            <p>
                I graduated from Oregon State University in June of 2024 with a
                BS in Computer Science. My focus was computer systems, which involved
                operating systems, computer networking & security,
                compilers, and embedded systems.
                <br><br>
                During my time at OSU I learned many practical skills on a range
                of topics; I learned how to work on a large project as
                part of a team, organizational and time management skills,
                practical development processes, and a number of different
                languages, tools, and techniques.

            <p>
                My senior capstone project was a prototype data logger designed
                for amateur aerospace and automotive enthusiasts called the
                Personal Data Acquisition Prototype, or P-DAQ. It is a physical
                device that can be attached to a cart, bike, model rocket, etc.
                with sensors for measuring temperature, acceleration, and GPS position
                to monitor performance. Our project targets an untapped market;
                devices such as this exist on the market already, but they are
                designed for industry professionals and are prohibitively expensive
                for amateur hobbyists. Our device is designed to be cheap, modular and
                easy to setup and use in order to target these potential users.
                <br><br>
                I worked as part of a team consisting of myself, my classmates Aidan Agee,
                Jake Goodwin, and Patrick Iacob, along with industry professional
                Chris Patton, former SpaceX engineer.
                The project was developed from start to finished in Rust over nine
                months with the direction of our project partner Chris Patton and
                the oversight of a teacher's assistant. After completion, me and my
                teammates presented our project at a public expo for College of
                Engineering capstone projects.

            <h2>My Role</h2>
            <p>
                I was part of the UI development subteam, and my focus was on
                data processing and display. I created data structures and
                functions to automatically refresh and
                asynchronously receive read data from a SQLite database to be
                displayed in graphs and tables using the Rust eGui framework.
                I took great effort to ensure null safety and modularity, to
                reduce unexpected behavior and allow for extensibility if sensors
                are added and removed.

                The user interface was designed by myself and my teammate Aidan
                Agee using the eGui Rust framework. It is
                hosted as a Rust Rocket webserver from the Raspberry PI, which could
                then be connected to over WiFi by a user's personal device.
                The map, graphs, and tables in the UI all use asynchronous
                functions to live-update based on data from the device's
                sensors stored in a SQLite database.

            <h2>Development Process</h2>
            <p>
                For this project we learned the practicalities of version
                control and project & team organization. We loosely followed the Scrum
                framework, holding weekly meetings with both our project TA and project
                partner to review progress and plan sprints.
                Along the way we learned the importance of establishing appropriate deadlines
                regularly reporting our progress, and by the end
                of the project we were working very well together and I am proud
                of what we created.
                <br><br>
                The course taught us how to explicitly define requirements,
                architecture, and our development process in documents and how
                to write up weekly reports. This was unfamiliar to us at first
                because we had never needed to explicitly define these things
                as we had never worked on a project of this scale or duration
                before, but it ended up being useful to clearly define our plans
                and expectations beforehand.

                A small shell made in C for my operating systems class as an exercise
                to learn how forking and processes work. Reads user input and
                parses it into command and arguments. Implements built-in
                commands <code>cd</code>, <code>status</code> and <code>exit</code>;
                all other commands are executed by forking the process and
                replacing the child using the built in Unix command <code>exec</code>.
                Also supports input and
                output redirection, running processes in the background, and reading
                the shell's pid.

            <h2>Active Queue Management Technique Experiments</h2>
            <p>
                Active queue management (AQM) is a general approach for managing
                congestion in computer networks. As part of a group project
                for my Computer Networking class
                myself and two classmates researched, implemented, and tested
                several different AQM techniques. We read a series of IEEE papers
                where each technique was first introduced, then based on what
                we read we implemented the techniques in the NS3 C++ network
                simulator, ran experiments with them, and finally reported our
                results, which roughly matched what we found in our research.
