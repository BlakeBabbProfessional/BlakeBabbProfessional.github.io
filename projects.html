            <h2>Game Jams</h2>
            <p>
                A Game Jam is a competition to develop and publish
                a small game from start to
                finish in a set period of time. They are usually community judged
                and ranked on creativity, aestetics, and gameplay. I have
                participated in numerous Game Jams solo and as part of a team.
                Below is a selection of my favorite submissions.

                Developed in GameMaker over two weeks by me and my sibling Meta
                for the Mech Jam V.
                Play as the operator of a mech repair facility fixing up mechs
                damaged in combat. Experimental gameplay inspired by claw machines
                and industrial manufacturing facilities.
                <br><br>
                Meta drew the mechs and the background and did most of the sound
                design while I programmed it and drew the control panel.
                Still a work in progress, as playtesting revealed flaws in the
                tutorial, which is being reworked with playtester feedback.

                Developed in GameMaker over 72 hours for the Winter Melon Jam 2023
                as part of a team of four.
                Play as the owner of a sinister beauty parlor and try to convince
                monsters to accept your "treatments".
                <br><br>
                This was the first complete game I made in GameMaker, which we
                chose because of its ease of use and ability to export to HTML5,
                which is much more accessible and convenient for players. This
                was also my first game I worked on as part of such a large team,
                which went very well.

                Developed in Java over 72 hours for Mini Jam 87 as part of a team of
                three. Play as a little creature lost and injured in a dark forest,
                who must scavenge new body parts to make their way back to their
                family.
                <br><br>
                Was an unexpected hit on Itch.io, organically drawing several
                thousand views and over one thousand downloads.
                <br><br>
                I am particularly proud of this one because of its strong atmosphere,
                brought to life by my sibling Meta's incredible creature and background
                design, my friend Raine's expressive creature AI, and my sound and
                level design.

                Developed in Java over 72 hours for Mini Jam 84 by me and my
                sibling Meta. A silly little arcade game about trying to protect
                pufferfish from becoming dinner in a seafood restaraunt by
                flinging them into things.
                <br><br>
                The first game I worked on as part of a collaboration; my sibling
                Meta did all the art and sound design, and I did all the
                programming. Placed first in the Game Jam out of 154 entries as rated
                by fellow participants.
                <br><br>
                I'm very proud of this one, it feels very
                simple yet high-quality. I keep telling myself I'll try something
                less ambitious like this, but I find myself drawn to heady concepts
                and unique challenges.

                Play as an explorer spelunking in dark dangerous caves, that must
                roll magic dice to create a light source.
                <br><br>
                This was
                my second ever Game Jam, and I did it completely solo; doing all the
                programming, art, sound design, and level design.
                Placed ninth for the concept out of 115 entries as rated by fellow
                participants.

                A tower defence game made in Java that I have been developing
                off and on for several years. In it you play as a defence contractor
                protecting mining operations in a distant land from wacky critters.
                There are five levels so far with dozens of waves of enemies each,
                over a dozen hand-animated defensive towers, and around 100 different
                enemies.
                <br><br>
                I started this project in high school when I was first learning
                Java, and I have been using it as a place to dump my creative
                energy when I'm bored. I
                did all the backgrounds, animation, sound design, level design,
                and programming myself.

                speculative depiction of the real-life TRAPPIST-1 exoplanet system
                based on real scientific research. Intended as a way to teach about
                the TRAPPIST-1 system and exoplanet research in general.
