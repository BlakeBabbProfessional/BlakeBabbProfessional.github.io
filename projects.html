        <h2>Game Jams</h2>
        <p>
            A Game Jam is a competition to develop and publish
            a small game from start to
            finish in a set period of time. They are usually community judged
            and ranked on creativity, aestetics, and gameplay. I have
            participated in numerous Game Jams solo and as part of a team.
            Below is a selection of my favorites.

            Developed in GameMaker over two weeks by me and my sibling Meta
            for the Mech Jam V.
            Play as the operator of a mech repair facility fixing up mechs
            damaged in combat. Experimental gameplay inspired by claw machines
            and industrial manufacturing facilities.
            <br><br>
            Meta drew the mechs and the background and did most of the sound
            design while I programmed it and drew the control panel.
            Still a work in progress, as playtesting revealed flaws in the
            tutorial, which is being reworked with playtester feedback.

        <p>
            Developed in GameMaker over 72 hours for the Winter Melon Jam 2023
            as part of a team of four.
            Play as the owner of a sinister beauty parlor and try to convince
            monsters to accept your "treatments".
            <br><br>
            This was the first complete game I made in GameMaker, which we
            chose because of its ease of use and ability to export to HTML5,
            which is much more accessible and convenient for players. This
            was also my first game I worked on as part of such a large team,
            which went unexpectedly well; we worked very well together.
            <br><br>
            Monster Parlor was an unexpected hit on YouTube, with a lets play
            by YouTuber ManlyBadassHero accumulating over one hundred thousand
            views, inspiring several theory and analysis videos. This was
            quite unexpected as we had done no marketing besides submitting
            to the Winter Melon Jam and publishing on Itch.io, it is thanks
            to ManlyBadassHero that our game was found.

            Developed in Java 8 over 72 hours for Mini Jam 87 as part of a team of
            three. Play as a little creature lost an injured in a dark forest,
            who must scavenge new body parts to make their way back to their
            family.
            <br><br>
            Was an unexpected hit on Itch.io, organically drawing several
            thousand views and over one thousand downloads.
            <br><br>
            I am particularly proud of this one because of its strong atmosphere,
            brought to life by my sibling Meta's incredible creature and background
            design, my friend Raine's expressive creature AI, and my sound and
            level design.

            Developed in Java 8 over 72 hours for Mini Jam 84 by me and my
            sibling Meta. A silly little arcade game about trying to protect
            pufferfish from being caught and cooked in a seafood restaraunt by
            flinging them into things.
            <br><br>
            The first game I worked on as part of a collaboration, with my sibling
            Meta doing all the art and sound design, and myself doing all the
            programming. Placed first in the Game Jam out of 154 entries as rated
            by fellow participants.
            <br><br>
            I'm very proud of this one, it feels very
            simple yet high-quality. I keep telling myself I'll try something
            less ambitious like this, but I find myself drawn to heady concepts
            and unique challenges.

            Developed in Java 8 over 72 hours for Mini Jam 83, solo.
            Play as an explorer spelunking in dark dangerous caves, that must
            roll magic dice to create a light source.
            <br><br>
            This was
            my second ever Game Jam, and I did it completely solo; doing all the
            programming, art, sound design, and level design.
            Placed ninth for the concept out of 115 entries as rated by fellow
            participants.
